# PEDAL POWER

Pedal Power is an interactive, Python-based GUI program that encourages sustainability through biking. Biking is a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation. The application will enable users to input their rides and track how much they contribute to reducing their carbon footprint by using a bike as their mode of transportation. The app encourages users to continue biking through weekly challenges that suggest users ride a longer distance throughout the week and gives them virtual badges.
